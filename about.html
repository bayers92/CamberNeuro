						<p>
							His roles at big pharma companies include 8 years of basic research as a medicinal chemist, and a further 14 years of increasing responsibilities that included product / technology licensing, corporate development, worldwide business development, and lastly leading the M&A function for a multinational healthcare company. In these senior executive capacities he has worked for Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer and Novartis.  He is known for his ability to manage complex cross-cultural and cross-border negotiations involving collaborations on products in late stage development which require large capital commitments in support of their commercial launch strategies.  Further details on some of his noteworthy accomplishments in this effort are listed below.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the Licensing and Development Department at Pfizer, Jim managed the project flow and business development initiatives of 9 senior level Licensing executives who were targeting collaborations or acquisitions of products in the final stages of their development process at other pharma or biotech companies.   He took a primary role in several landmark deals forged by Pfizer in the 1994-1998 timeframe. The first of these was the worldwide “Strategic Marketing Alliance on Celebrex® and Bextra® forged with Searle.  These products were the first-in-class Cox-2 selective anti-inflammatories to launch in the U.S. market. Also during this timeframe, he crafted three cornerstone agreements enabling the commercial scale manufacturing of recombinant human insulin which was to launch into the market under the brand name Exubra®.  These agreements involved the greenfield construction of an insulin manufacturing plant in Frankfurt, Germany, with Aventis, and two additional manufacturing agreements with Nektar Therapeutics on the commercial scale production of powdered insulin and the inhaler device which would be used in both Type 1 and 2 diabetics.
