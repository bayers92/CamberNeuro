							Camber NeuroTherapeutics Inc. is a new company formed for the purpose of commercializing a group of novel small molecule therapeutics which have displayed exceptional potency in preclinical models for the treatment of memory and cognitive disorders resulting from neuroinflammatory processes.
							The Company’s product pipeline represents 20 years of innovative research which has been funded by $25 mm of various grants from the National Institute of Health.
							Camber NeuroTherapeutics has entered into a licensing transaction with the University of Rochester Medical Center, the site of preclinical research that generated the portfolio of clinical drug candidates. The license provides Camber NeuroTherapeutics exclusivity on a series of patented novel drug candidates which have high selectivity for inhibition of the Mixed Lineage Kinases.
							The Company anticipates commencing a Phase 1 clinical study by 2Q16 with its lead drug candidate, URMC-099, which will target the treatment of POCD ( Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction ).
							Another Ph. 1 study with this drug candidate is planned to commence in 2016 for the treatment of HAND ( HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorders ).  The treatment of cognitive disorders associated with Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson’s Disease also figure prominently in the Company’s project plans.
							Based on standard drug development timelines, regulatory requirements, and the timely completion of our pivotal clinical trials, Camber expects to launch its first product for the treatment of POCD in the 2021-2022 timeframe.

							Founder, Chairman and CEO – Dr. Jim New
						</h3>
						<p>
							Jim’s industry experience spans the science and business elements of commercial pharmaceutical operations on both the branded and generic sides of the business.  After 8 years of basic research experience as a medicinal chemist, he moved into product licensing and business development functions, and from there progressed into Mergers and Acquisitions.  Collectively, he has worked at BMS, GSK, Pfizer and Novartis for over a period of 23 years.  In 2002, he was co-founder of Abrika Pharmaceuticals, a generic drug company specializing in controlled-release products, which was acquired by Actavis in 2007.
							Since 2007, Jim has expanded his biotech experience by being CEO of Lifecycle Pharma ( now known as Veloxis Pharmaceuticals ), AIKO Biotech, and most recently Neurotrope Bioscience ( NTRP; OTCBB.)
							He has a B.A. in Biology from SUNY Geneseo, a M.S. in Biochemistry from the Univ. of Maine at Orono, a Ph.D. in Medicinal Chemistry from SUNY Buffalo, and a M.B.A. from Columbia.

							Dr. Harris A. Gelbard
						</h3>
						<p>
							Dr. Gelbard is the Chairperson for the SAB.  Dr. Gelbard is the Director of the Center for Neural Development and Disease and Professor of Neurology, Pediatrics and Microbiology & Immunology at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Dr. Gelbard has 25 years of experience as a molecular neuropharmacologist, working in experimental models of neuroAIDS and HIV-1 neuroinflammation since 1992. As the leader of the NeuroAIDS research group in the UR's NIH-funded Development Center for AIDS Research and PO1 MH64570, in collaboration with Drs. Steve Dewhurst and Sanjay Maggirwar from the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dr. Gelbard has worked to develop new therapies for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) over the past several years with a programmatic effort supported by the NIMH for over 10 years.
						</p>
						<p>
							Dr. Gelbard's lab has designed a highly selective group of small molecule inhibitors of Mixed Lineage Kinase enzymes and has tested several of these prototype drugs in in vitro and in vivo models for HAND.  This body of innovative work has recently been licensed to Camber NeuroTherapeutics who plans on progressing the technology into a series of therapeutic modalities for the treatment of certain CNS pathologies which involve neuroinflammation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Dr. Gelbard obtained his B.S. from Northwestern University, a Ph.D. in pharmacology from Northwestern and a M.D. from Northwestern.  He completed his internship and residency at Children’s Memorial Hosipital at Northwestern University and a Fellowship in Developmental Neuropharmacology at McLean Hospital.  He is author or co-author on over 94 original scientific publications and numerous recently issued patents that cover his work in drugs designed to inhibit neuroinflammation.

							Dr. Howard E. Gendelman
						</h3>
						<p>
							Dr. Howard E. Gendelman is the Margaret R. Larson Professor of Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Chairman of the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience, and Director of the Center for Neurodegenerative Disorders at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Dr. Gendelman is credited in unraveling how functional alterations in brain immunity induce metabolic changes and ultimately lead to neural cell damage for a broad range of infectious, metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. These discoveries have had broad implications in developmental therapeutics aimed at preventing, slowing or reversing neural maladies. He is also credited for the demonstration that AIDS dementia is a reversible metabolic encephalopathy, a finding realized at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. His work has led to novel immunotherapy and nanomedicine strategies for Parkinson’s and viral diseases being tested in early clinical trials as a result of intense translational investigations.
						</p>
						<p>
							The major focus for his research is on the role played by glial inflammatory activities in brain disease. The work bridges immunology, neuroscience and pharmacology and crosses disease barriers for studies of HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The major goal is to use immune-based approaches to reverse nerve cell damages.
						</p>
						<p>
							Dr. Gendelman obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Natural Sciences and Russian Studies with honors from Muhlenberg College and his M.D. from the Pennsylvania State University-Hershey Medical Center where he was the 1999 Distinguished Alumnus. He completed a residency in Internal medicine at Montefiore Hospital, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and was a Clinical and Research Fellow in Neurology and Infectious Diseases at the Johns Hopkins University Medical Center. He occupied senior faculty and research positions at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Center, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and the Henry Jackson Foundation for the Advancement in Military Medicine before joining the University of Nebraska Medical Center faculty in March of 1993. He retired from the US Army with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Dr. Gendelman has authored over 400 peer-reviewed publications, edited nine books and monographs, holds eight patents, is the Editor-In-Chief and Founder of the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology along with service on numerous editorial boards, national and international scientific review and federal and state committees.
